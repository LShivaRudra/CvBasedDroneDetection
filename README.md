This project aims to implement object detection using YOLOv3 and YoLov5 algorithms to identify drones in images. The models were trained using images from the COCO dataset, with additional bird images included to expand the dataset and test the models' effectiveness.
Techniques like Image Augmentation and Layer freezing were used to improve the performance metrics.
